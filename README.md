There's not really any AI here, but that's a whole other thing.

### Todo:  
-properly dispose resources, increase performance
-better generational structure

### Ideas:
-create a relatively simple data type that holds all information needed to generate an image (the dna of an image)  

### List of Known Variables:
These are independent variables that require further investigation/testing:  
-max side length  
-number of triangles  
-number of images  
-threshold (currently narrowed on 518 - 741)  
-likelyhood to generate random triangle when combining  
-new algorithm for comparing pixel byte data?
